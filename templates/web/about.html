</p>
<br> <br> 
    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
    <br>
    <p>Welcome to Georegistry.org, the geospatial health repository developed
    by the <a HREF="http://www.earth.columbia.edu/"> 
    Earth Institute </a> at Columbia University. What makes Georegistry.org special
    is that it is designed to result in high-quality, vetted, health information
    related to specific points-of-interest (POI) of value to development: health,
    education, water and sanitation. Information may be read or written from
    multiple sources, including mobile devices, spreadsheets, and websites.</p>
    <br>
    <p>
    In short, Georegistry makes it easy for governments and NGOs to share, visualize,
    and report information.

    Georegistry provides a standardized way to collect and store health data
    that is too often kept in spreadsheets in incompatible formats. If you are a
    software developer you may be interested in the
    <a HREF="http://readthedocs.org/docs/georegistry/latest/"> developer documentation</a>,
    or you may wish to <a href="http://api.georegistry.org/accounts/register">request access</a> to the
    application programming interface(API).
